# PAF_2018


A project in pair that examines a brand-new method to do classification : transfer learning by boosting.
It consists in using projections of a classifier in higher dimensions (first at random) in order to do classification.
In our project, projections are expressed as matrices and we explore ways to optimize and use boosting to compute a strong classifier.
